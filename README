Description:
------------

FCam is a C++ camera control API, designed for easy, precise, and
complete control of a camera platform.  It's based on the
Frankencamera architecture, described in a paper available at
http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/fcam/, developed as part of the
Camera 2.0 Project at the Stanford University Graphics Lab.

This document refers to the implementation of FCam on the Tegra 3
prototype tablet.


Documentation:
--------------

FCam is documented using the Doxygen document generator system.  HTML
documentation can be found in doc/html if it is prebuilt - otherwise,
install doxygen, and run it in the FCam directory to build the
documentation.


Examples:
---------

The examples/ tree contains several sample programs that excercise the
API in various ways.  Each example has a HOWTOBUILD file with build
instructions.  The Tegra 3 prototype tablets run the Android OS.  It
is recommended that you download the NVIDIA Tegra Development pack
from
        http://developer.nvidia.com/tegra-resources
to get started.
